The function two_sum(nums, target) takes in an array of integers nums and an integer target.

num_indices is a dictionary that will be used to store the indices of elements in the nums array. The keys of this dictionary will 
be the elements themselves, and the values will be their corresponding indices.

The function iterates through the nums array using enumerate(), which gives both the index i and the value num at each iteration.

For each element num, it calculates the complement required to reach the target by subtracting num from target. This complement is stored 
in the variable complement.

It then checks if the complement exists in the num_indices dictionary. If it does, it means that the current num and the complement form 
a pair that adds up to the target. In this case, it returns the indices of the current element num and its complement from the dictionary.

If the complement does not exist in the dictionary, it means that the current element num does not have a complement in the previous elements 
to add up to the target. So it stores the index of the current element num in the num_indices dictionary with the key as num.

If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns None, indicating that there are no two elements in the nums array 
that add up to the target.







Initialize the input:

#Example
nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target1 = 9

Create an empty dictionary num_indices to store the indices of elements.

Start iterating through the nums1 array using enumerate():

First iteration (i = 0, num = 2):

Calculate the complement: complement = target1 - num = 9 - 2 = 7
Check if complement exists in num_indices dictionary. It doesn't.
Store the index of num in the dictionary: num_indices[2] = 0
Second iteration (i = 1, num = 7):

Calculate the complement: complement = target1 - num = 9 - 7 = 2
Check if complement exists in num_indices dictionary. It does (because 2 was stored earlier).
Return the indices of the current element (7) and its complement (2), which are [0, 1].
The function returns [0, 1], indicating that the elements at indices 0 and 1 (i.e., 2 and 7) add up to the target1, which is 9.

So, the output for two_sum(nums1, target1) is [0, 1], as expected. This means that the elements at indices 0 and 1 
of the nums1 array add up to the target1.

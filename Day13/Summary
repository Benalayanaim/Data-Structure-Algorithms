Both Solution 1 and Solution 2 aim to implement a linked list data structure with similar functionalities, but they have differences in their design and implementation. Let's compare them step by step.

Solution 1
ListNode Class
Represents a single node in the linked list.
Contains a val to store the node's value and a next to point to the next node.
MyLinkedList Class
Manages the linked list.
Has a head to point to the first node and size to keep track of the number of nodes.
Methods in MyLinkedList
get(self, index: int) -> int:

Retrieves the value at the specified index.
Returns -1 if the index is out of bounds.
addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:

Adds a node with the specified value at the beginning.
Uses addAtIndex(0, val) for implementation.
addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:

Adds a node with the specified value at the end.
Uses addAtIndex(self.size, val) for implementation.
addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:

Adds a node with the specified value before the node at the given index.
Handles edge cases where the index is greater than the size or less than 0.
deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:

Deletes the node at the specified index.
Adjusts the size accordingly.
Solution 2
Node Class
Similar to ListNode in Solution 1.
Represents a single node in the linked list with data and next.
LinkedList Class
Manages the linked list.
Has a head to point to the first node.
Methods in LinkedList
insertAtBegin(self, data):

Adds a node with the specified value at the beginning.
insertAtIndex(self, data, index):

Adds a node with the specified value at the given index.
Handles edge cases where the index is out of bounds.
insertAtEnd(self, data):

Adds a node with the specified value at the end.
updateNode(self, val, index):

Updates the value of the node at the specified index.
remove_first_node(self):

Removes the first node.
remove_last_node(self):

Removes the last node.
remove_at_index(self, index):

Removes the node at the specified index.
remove_node(self, data):

Removes the first node with the specified value.
sizeOfLL(self):

Returns the size of the linked list.
printLL(self):

Prints the values of all nodes in the linked list.
Differences and Similarities
Size Management: Solution 1 explicitly tracks the size of the list, making certain operations like addAtTail and get more efficient. Solution 2 calculates the size on demand with the sizeOfLL method.
Functionality: Both solutions provide methods for adding, updating, and removing nodes. However, Solution 1 provides a more robust and concise approach with fewer explicit methods but more combined functionality (e.g., addAtIndex for adding at head, tail, and specific index).
Implementation: Solution 1 is more concise with fewer methods, relying on internal methods (addAtIndex for multiple functionalities). Solution 2 has a more traditional approach with separate methods for each operation.
Edge Cases: Both handle edge cases but in slightly different ways. Solution 1 ensures indexes are within bounds by checking index < 0 or index >= self.size in multiple methods. Solution 2 checks for valid indexes and handles them differently in methods like insertAtIndex and remove_at_index.
Overall, Solution 1 is more efficient and compact, while Solution 2 is more explicit and traditional in its approach.
